# AI Post Writing Guidelines for Tinnitus Help

## Structure (Flexible 5-8 Core Sections)

**Common Post Types:**

- **"What is..."** (Explanatory): Definition → Symptoms → Causes → Diagnosis → Treatment/Management → Conclusion
- **"How to..."** (Tutorial): Introduction → Why it matters → Step-by-step strategies → Best practices → When to seek help → Conclusion
- **"Tinnitus and..."** (Relationship/Connection): Introduction → Connection explanation → Mechanisms → Management strategies → Conclusion
- **Question-based** (e.g., "Does tinnitus go away?"): Question → Answer overview → Types/context → Factors → Management → Conclusion

**FLEXIBILITY**: Add contextual sections as needed (e.g., "Research and Future Outlook", "Common Myths", "When to See a Doctor", "Risk Factors").

For **"How to..."** and beginner-focused guides, aim for this typical flow:

- **Engaging introduction (2–3 paragraphs)** – relatable scenario, acknowledge reader concerns, set expectations
- **Why this matters / stakes** – what can go wrong or what value is unlocked
- **Core concepts / basics** – minimal theory needed to understand the steps
- **Step‑by‑step / practical section** – clear actions, checklists supported by narrative
- **Common mistakes / FAQs / troubleshooting** – show, don't just tell, how things go wrong in practice
- **Conclusion** – reinforce key takeaways, build confidence, and suggest safe next steps

## Content Requirements

- **Length**: 1,200-2,500 words
- **Internal Links**: 8-15 total, flowing naturally throughout content
- **Images**: Exactly 2 with descriptive alt text using `/images/` paths
  - First: After main concept or first major section
  - Second: Before conclusion or after practical sections
- **Formatting**: Use `<Highlighter>` tags for main section headings, **bold** for sub-categories in bullet points
- **Tone**: Professional, empathetic, educational, expert-level, E-E-A-T compliant, accessible to beginners when possible
- **Special Components**:
  - `<Blockquote>` at the beginning with 2-3 sentence summary
  - `<AdComponent />` placed 2-3 times throughout (after major sections)
  - `<Image>` components with descriptive alt text

## Internal Linking (ALWAYS USE NATURAL FORMAT)

**MANDATORY FORMAT**: Links should flow naturally in sentences, NOT forced phrases like "see our guide on..."

**DO Link When:**

- Core concepts at first mention: "understanding **[tinnitus](/blog/what-is-tinnitus)**"
- Related educational content when naturally connecting: "If you're new to tinnitus management, our **[managing tinnitus](/blog/managing-tinnitus)** guide..."
- Practical guides in context: "Learn more: **[How Audiologists Diagnose and Treat Tinnitus](/blog/how-audiologists-diagnose-and-treat-tinnitus)**"
- Related conditions/topics: "linked to **[stress and anxiety](/blog/tinnitus-and-stress)**"
- Sound therapy resources: "explore our **[Zen sound library](/zen)**" or "try **[white noise](/zen/white-noise)**"
- Management strategies: "effective **[sound therapy](/blog/the-power-of-white-noise)**"
- When referencing specific sections: "common **[causes of tinnitus](/blog/what-is-tinnitus#what-causes-tinnitus-uncovering-the-roots)**"

**DON'T Link:**

- Every mention of common terms (only when it adds value)
- With forced phrases like "see our guide on..." - let links flow naturally
- Multiple links in the same sentence
- As keyword stuffing or when it interrupts reading flow
- Repeated linking to same page (once per major section is enough)

**Link Validation:**

- ONLY use links from provided database (blog posts, zen sounds)
- Database format: `key|slug|title` - use exact slug from database
- **Blog Posts**: **[Title](/blog/{slug})**
- **Zen Sounds**: **[Sound Name](/zen/{slug})**
- **App**: **[our app](/app)** or **[tinnitus relief app](/app)**

## Writing Standards

- **Specific Numbers & Data**: Use exact numbers "millions worldwide", "15-20% of adults", "60/60 rule" - AVOID vague terms like "many", "most", "several" when specific data is available
- **Medical Accuracy**: Always acknowledge when evidence is limited, use phrases like "some research suggests", "may help", "for some individuals" when evidence is not definitive
- **Risk Context**: Include naturally when discussing treatments or strategies (e.g., "Always consult your healthcare provider before trying new supplements")
- **Balanced Tone**: Acknowledge both the challenges AND hope - be realistic but encouraging (e.g., "While there's no cure, effective management strategies can significantly improve quality of life")
- **Actionable Content**: Provide practical advice with context, explain "why" not just "what"
- **Natural Voice**: Vary sentence length, avoid AI-like filler ("In conclusion", "Furthermore" - use sparingly), write conversationally but professionally
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Explain technical terms on first use when concept is central, link to foundational content when appropriate
- **Empathetic Tone**: Acknowledge the reader's challenges and concerns directly, use "you" to address them personally
- **Research-Backed**: Reference current research when available, but acknowledge limitations and ongoing studies

### Narrative & Engagement

- **Directly address the reader**: Use "you"/"your" to speak to the reader and acknowledge their worries, curiosity, and goals
- **Use rhetorical questions sparingly but effectively**: e.g., "Wondering why stress makes tinnitus worse?" to open sections and guide attention
- **Leverage analogies and metaphors**: Explain complex ideas with simple comparisons (e.g., "Think of tinnitus like a smoke alarm that won't turn off—the sound itself isn't dangerous, but it signals something needs attention")
- **Balance narrative and checklists**: Use bullet lists and tables for clarity, but **always surround them with short narrative paragraphs** that explain why each step/section matters. Avoid posts that feel like pure checklists or manuals
- **Encouraging, reassuring tone**: Especially for beginners and management topics, combine honest discussion of challenges with reassurance that, by following clear strategies, the reader can improve their situation
- **Acknowledge the struggle**: Recognize that living with tinnitus is difficult, validate the reader's experience

## Category Selection (MANDATORY - Use ONLY These Categories)

Choose 1-4 categories from this EXACT list (no other categories allowed):

- **Basics** – Foundational, introductory content about tinnitus
- **Management** – Practical strategies, techniques, and approaches for managing tinnitus
- **Research** – Scientific research, studies, and evidence-based information
- **Psychology** – Mental health, emotional impact, stress, anxiety, depression related to tinnitus
- **Nutrition** – Dietary approaches, supplements, hydration, lifestyle factors
- **Meditation** – Mindfulness, meditation, relaxation techniques
- **Sounds** – Sound therapy, white noise, nature sounds, audio-based treatments

**Guidelines**: Choose 2-3 optimal categories, match to post's primary focus (not just mentioned terms), quality over quantity.

## Tag Generation

Generate 8-15 SEO-focused tags covering:

- Primary topic/condition (e.g., "tinnitus", "hearing loss", "sound therapy")
- Symptoms/experiences (e.g., "ringing in ears", "buzzing", "sleep problems")
- Management strategies (e.g., "stress management", "meditation", "white noise")
- Related conditions (e.g., "anxiety", "depression", "insomnia")
- Audience (e.g., "beginners", "veterans", "musicians")
- Treatment types (e.g., "CBT", "hearing aids", "sound masking")

## Opening Style

**Effective Patterns:**

- **Engaging Hook**: "Tinnitus, characterized by persistent ringing, buzzing, or other sounds in the ears without an external source, can significantly impact daily life."
- **Question Hook**: "Does tinnitus go away on its own? This is one of the most common questions asked by those experiencing this challenging condition."
- **Relatable Scenario**: "You're lying in bed, trying to fall asleep, but the constant ringing in your ears makes it impossible to find peace..."
- **Definition & Significance**: "[Topic] is [definition]. It represents..." - Always include WHY it matters

**Requirements**:

- Start with **2–3 short paragraphs**, not a bullet list
- Use at least one of:
  - A **relatable scenario** ("You've noticed your tinnitus gets worse when you're stressed...")
  - A **question hook** ("Wondering if your tinnitus will ever go away?")
  - A **short context or connection** tied to tinnitus management
- Explicitly **acknowledge the reader's situation and concerns** (e.g., anxiety about symptoms, frustration with lack of sleep, confusion about treatment options)
- Clearly state **what they will learn** and **why it matters now**
- Include ONE natural internal link where it adds context (not forced)
- Avoid starting with dense medical definitions alone—lead with connection, then explain
- **ALWAYS include a `<Blockquote>` section** right after frontmatter with a 2-3 sentence summary that highlights key points

## Conclusion Style

- Every post MUST end with a **Conclusion section** using a clear heading, e.g., `<Highlighter>Conclusion: [Short Benefit-Oriented Phrase]</Highlighter>` or `<Highlighter>Conclusion</Highlighter>`
- The conclusion should be **2–3 paragraphs**, not just a bullet checklist
- Summarize the **key takeaways in plain language** and restate why the topic matters
- **Reinforce hope and confidence**: make it clear that by following the outlined concepts/strategies, the reader can improve their situation
- Where relevant, suggest **1–2 practical next steps** (e.g., which related guide to read next, what small action to take first, when to seek professional help), linking internally in a natural way
- End on an encouraging, forward-looking note

## Frontmatter Requirements

**Title Formats:**
