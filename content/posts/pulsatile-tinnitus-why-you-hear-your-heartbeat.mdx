  Hearing your heartbeat in your ear is called pulsatile tinnitus. This guide explains what it is, why it happens, the red flags that need urgent care, and practical steps to diagnose and manage it—so you can feel informed and in control.
</Blockquote>

You’re lying in bed and the room is quiet, but your ear is anything but. A whooshing sound keeps time with your pulse—as if a tiny drum is beating inside your head. It’s unsettling, distracting, and hard to ignore.

If this sounds familiar, you may be dealing with pulsatile tinnitus, a specific form of tinnitus where the sound syncs with your heartbeat. You’ll learn what causes it, how doctors evaluate it, which symptoms need prompt attention, and what you can do today to get relief. For a refresher on the broader condition, understanding the basics of **[tinnitus](/blog/what-is-tinnitus)** can help you put pulsatile tinnitus in context.

<Highlighter>What Is Pulsatile Tinnitus?</Highlighter>

**Pulsatile tinnitus** is the perception of a rhythmic “whoosh,” “thump,” or “heartbeat” in the ear without an external sound source. Unlike common, steady ringing or buzzing, pulsatile tinnitus is typically synchronous with your pulse. It’s less common—often estimated in 4–10% of tinnitus presentations—but it matters because it can be linked to identifiable, sometimes treatable, causes.

Two key distinctions:
- **Subjective vs. objective**: Most tinnitus is “subjective” (only you hear it). Some pulsatile cases are “objective,” meaning a clinician can sometimes hear the sound with a stethoscope over the ear or skull.
- **Vascular vs. non-vascular** origins: Pulsatile tinnitus is frequently related to blood flow (arterial or venous) near the ear. Non-vascular causes (like middle ear fluid) can also create rhythmic sounds.

<Highlighter>Why You Hear Your Heartbeat: The Science</Highlighter>

Your ears sit next to an intricate network of arteries and veins. When blood flow becomes turbulent (like water rushing through a narrowed pipe), it can generate sound. That sound may travel through bone and soft tissues to your middle ear where it’s amplified, especially if:
- **A vessel is narrowed or kinked** (e.g., carotid artery disease, venous sinus stenosis)
- **Pressure dynamics change** (e.g., idiopathic intracranial hypertension)
- **Sound conduction is enhanced** (e.g., a thin or dehiscent bone plate over a blood vessel, or fluid in the middle ear)

Here’s how pulsatile tinnitus compares to more typical (non-pulsatile) tinnitus:

| Feature | Non-pulsatile tinnitus | Pulsatile tinnitus |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Sound quality** | Constant ringing, buzzing, hissing | Rhythmic whooshing or thumping in time with heartbeat |
| **Common causes** | Hearing loss, noise exposure, medications | Vascular flow changes, middle ear fluid, tumors, pressure disorders |
| **Urgency** | Usually non-urgent; exceptions apply | Often merits medical evaluation; some causes need prompt care |
| **Common tests** | Hearing test, tympanometry | Hearing test plus targeted imaging (CTA/MRA/MRV), sometimes ultrasound |
| **Treatability** | Symptom-focused | Often cause-directed treatment is possible |

Because anxiety can amplify sound perception, it helps to learn strategies from our guide on **[tinnitus and stress](/blog/tinnitus-and-stress)** while you seek a diagnosis.

<Highlighter>Common Causes of Pulsatile Tinnitus</Highlighter>

Think of causes in three clusters. Not every cause is dangerous, but many deserve evaluation:

- **Vascular (arterial/venous)**
  - **Atherosclerotic narrowing** of the carotid artery causing turbulent flow
  - **Dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF)** or **arteriovenous malformation (AVM)**
  - **Venous sinus stenosis** or dominant jugular bulb creating a turbulent “venous hum”
  - **Carotid dissection** (tearing of the artery wall; often sudden onset with neck pain—urgent)
  - **Hypertension** (high blood pressure) and elevated cardiac output states
- **Pressure/structural**
  - **Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)**—often in younger women; headache and visual symptoms can accompany
  - **Superior semicircular canal dehiscence** or **sigmoid sinus dehiscence** (thin/broken bone enhancing sound transmission)
- **Middle ear and ear-adjacent**
  - **Middle ear effusion** (fluid) or **Eustachian tube dysfunction**
  - **Glomus tumors (paragangliomas)**—vascular tumors in the middle ear or jugular bulb
- **Systemic**
  - **Anemia**, **thyroid disorders**, **pregnancy**, and **fever/infection** can increase flow or change viscosity
  - Certain medications or stimulants may influence blood pressure or perception (evidence varies)

If you’re curious about broader tinnitus causes and how they differ, skim the **[common causes of tinnitus](/blog/what-is-tinnitus#what-causes-tinnitus-uncovering-the-roots)** overview.

<Highlighter>When to Seek Medical Help (and Red Flags)</Highlighter>

Call your healthcare provider if you notice pulsatile tinnitus that:
- **Starts suddenly**, is one-sided, or follows head/neck trauma
- **Changes with head position or neck pressure**, or you can hear it across the head
- **Comes with headaches, visual disturbances, or transient vision loss** (possible IIH)
- **Occurs with neurological symptoms** (weakness, facial droop, slurred speech)
- **Occurs with severe neck pain** (possible carotid dissection)
- **Appears with ear fullness, drainage, or hearing loss**

Urgent evaluation is wise if any red flags are present. If you also notice sudden hearing changes, time matters—learn what clinicians do in **[How Audiologists Diagnose and Treat Tinnitus](/blog/how-audiologists-diagnose-and-treat-tinnitus)** and seek care promptly.

<Highlighter>How Pulsatile Tinnitus Is Diagnosed</Highlighter>

Your evaluation may involve a few steps. Not everyone needs every test; clinicians tailor the workup to your symptoms and exam.

1) **History and physical exam**
- **Characterize the sound**: timing with pulse, side, duration, triggers
- **Modulation clues**: Does turning your head, lying down, or gently pressing on the neck change the sound? (Note: don’t press hard—leave formal testing to professionals.)
- **Check blood pressure** and review medications, medical history, and recent illnesses

2) **Ear and hearing tests**
- **Otoscopy** to look for middle ear fluid or visible vascular tumors behind the eardrum
- **Audiometry** and **tympanometry** to assess hearing and middle ear pressure

3) **Targeted imaging** (as indicated)
- **CT or CTA** (computed tomography ± angiography) for bone and arterial detail
- **MRI/MRA/MRV** (magnetic resonance imaging/angiography/venography) for soft tissue and venous evaluation
- **Carotid ultrasound** when arterial stenosis is suspected

4) **Laboratory tests** (selective)
- **CBC** for anemia, **thyroid panel**, and other labs guided by your history

5) **Specialty referrals**
- **ENT/neurotology**, **neurology**, and **interventional radiology** may collaborate, depending on the suspected cause

If you’re navigating this process for the first time, our primer on **[managing tinnitus](/blog/managing-tinnitus)** can help you track symptoms and questions between appointments.

<Highlighter>Treatment: Fix the Cause vs. Ease the Sound</Highlighter>

There’s no one-size-fits-all treatment—your plan depends on the root cause. The good news: many causes are treatable.

- **Cause-directed treatments**
  - **Hypertension or atherosclerosis**: optimize blood pressure, cholesterol, and lifestyle
  - **Anemia**: treat iron deficiency or underlying causes
  - **Thyroid disorders**: correct hormonal imbalance
  - **IIH**: weight management, acetazolamide, and sometimes procedures to lower pressure
  - **Venous sinus stenosis**: endovascular stenting in selected cases
  - **dAVF/AVM**: embolization or surgery via specialized teams
  - **Glomus tumors**: surgical removal or radiotherapy
  - **Middle ear effusion**: medical therapy or myringotomy as needed

- **Symptom management** (supports quality of life while cause is addressed)
  - **Sound therapy** to reduce contrast and ease the “edge” of the whoosh. Learn about effective masking in **[The Power of White Noise](/blog/the-power-of-white-noise)** and try **[White Noise](/zen/white-noise)**, **[Nature Sounds](/zen/nature-sounds)**, or **[Water Sounds](/zen/water-sounds)** at comfortable volumes.
  - **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** can reduce distress and improve coping; explore **[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Tinnitus](/blog/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-tinnitus)**.
  - **Headphone strategy**: When appropriate, **[noise-canceling headphones](/blog/noise-canceling-headphones-for-tinnitus)** can lower environmental load; avoid unsafe volumes.
  - **Lifestyle**: sleep, stress, and cardiovascular fitness influence perception and triggers.

Always discuss procedures, medications, and supplements with your clinician first. There’s no guaranteed cure for tinnitus itself, but treating a specific pulsatile cause can sometimes resolve or greatly reduce the sound.

<Highlighter>Practical Daily Tips While You Await Evaluation</Highlighter>

Small changes can make the heartbeat sound less intrusive, especially at night.

- **Create a sound cushion**
  - Use gentle **[white noise](/zen/white-noise)** or soft **[evening sounds](/zen/evening-sounds)** to reduce the contrast in quiet rooms.
  - Keep the volume low—just enough to blend the whoosh. See our primer on **[The Power of White Noise](/blog/the-power-of-white-noise)** for safe practices.

- **Sleep smarter**
  - Elevate your head slightly and sleep on the side that’s more comfortable; position can affect venous flow. For more, browse **[Tinnitus and Sleep](/blog/tinnitus-and-sleep)**.
  - Follow a wind‑down routine and minimize caffeine late in the day.

- **Tame the stress cycle**
  - Stress ramps up attention and arousal, which can intensify perception. The tips in **[Tinnitus and Anxiety: Staying Mentally Strong](/blog/tinnitus-and-anxiety-staying-mentally-strong)** pair well with CBT skills.
  - Try short, daily mindfulness sessions; even 5 minutes helps. If you prefer guided tools, check **[Apps That Help Tinnitus](/blog/apps-that-help-tinnitus)** or try features in **[our app](/app)**.

- **Track patterns**
  - Note what changes the sound: posture, exercise, sleep, hormones, or salt intake. Share a 1–2 week log with your clinician.

- **Support cardiovascular health**
  - Balanced exercise, blood pressure control, and hydration can calm contributors like elevated pressure and heart rate variability. While the evidence isn’t absolute, these are good for overall health.

<Highlighter>FAQs and Quick Checks</Highlighter>

- **Can I “test” if it’s venous by pressing my neck?**  
Some venous causes change with gentle jugular pressure, but don’t do this at home. Neck compression can be risky. Let your clinician perform safe maneuvers.

- **Is pulsatile tinnitus dangerous?**  
Many causes aren’t dangerous, but some are time‑sensitive. Because a subset relates to vascular conditions, it’s important to get evaluated, especially if you notice red flags.

- **Will sound therapy make it worse?**  
Used correctly at low, comfortable levels, masking can reduce the contrast and annoyance. Avoid loud volumes and protect your hearing. If you’re sensitive to quiet, learn why silence can feel loud in **[Can Silence Make Tinnitus Worse](/blog/can-silence-make-tinnitus-worse)**.

- **What about the brain’s role?**  
Your brain’s attention, emotion, and auditory networks shape how loud and bothersome tinnitus feels. For context, see **[What Role Does the Brain Play in Tinnitus](/blog/what-role-does-the-brain-play-in-tinnitus)** and **[The Role of Neural Pathways in Tinnitus Perception](/blog/the-role-of-neural-pathways-in-tinnitus-perception)**.

- **Is there new research?**  
Yes—imaging, pressure disorders, and endovascular treatments are active areas. Keep up with **[Tinnitus Latest Research](/blog/tinnitus-latest-research)** for updates.

<Highlighter>Conclusion: From Worry to a Clear Plan</Highlighter>

Pulsatile tinnitus is the sound of your pulse in your ear, and it often points to an identifiable cause. That’s why a thoughtful medical evaluation matters. Many causes are manageable—and some are correctable—once you and your clinician pinpoint the source.

While you pursue answers, you can ease day‑to‑day distress with sound therapy, CBT‑based coping, and steady sleep routines. Start by logging your symptoms, using gentle **[white noise](/zen/white-noise)** at night, and scheduling a medical evaluation; if you’re new to the care pathway, **[How Audiologists Diagnose and Treat Tinnitus](/blog/how-audiologists-diagnose-and-treat-tinnitus)** outlines what to expect. You’re not alone, and with a clear plan, that internal drumbeat doesn’t have to run the show.
